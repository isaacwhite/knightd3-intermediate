            <p class="chart-description">The NYPD keeps a record of vehicle collisions which are reported in NYC. Data includes time, precise location, borough, zip code, possible contributing factors to the incident, as well as categories of persons injured/killed. Individual data for each report <a href="https://github.com/isaacwhite/knightd3-intermediate/blob/master/module1/hw/data_cleanup/main.js">has been reduced</a> to aggregate totals of deaths, injuries, and reported incidents by month for this chart. Original data from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95">NYC Open Data</a>.</p>
